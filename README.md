# tagem

Ever feel like your tagging process is slower than a sloth on Sunday? worry no more!  
**tagem** is a bash exe to help you create and push Git tags faster! (I needed it, so I put it out here for y'all)


## Usage

1. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x tagem.sh
  ```
2. Run it with your version and a message:
   ```bash
  ./tagem.sh Vx.x "Release version x.x with resource fixes"
  ```
3. It creates, writes the message for you (ish), pushes them with just one line of code! 

## Why?

## **No more* forgetting to push your tags.
## **no more** long Git commands to remember.
## **yes more** to more time for coding.

Now go tag 'em all, nerds!
